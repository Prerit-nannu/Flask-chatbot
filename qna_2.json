      "What is Python"

    ],
    "answer": "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows."

    "question": [
      "Why was Python created in the first place?"
    ],
    "answer": "I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about language design. This is the origin of many Python features, including the use of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of very-high-level data types (although the details are all different in Python)."

  {
    "topic": "newsgroup or mailing list",
    "question": [
      "Is there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python"
    ],
    "answer": "There is a newsgroup, comp.lang.python, and a mailing list, python-list. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other – if you can read news it’s unnecessary to subscribe to the mailing list. comp.lang.python is high-traffic, receiving hundreds of postings every day, and Usenet readers are often more able to cope with this volume. \n\nAnnouncements of new software releases and events can be found in comp.lang.python.announce, a low-traffic moderated list that receives about five postings per day. It’s available as the python-announce mailing list."

      "Are there any published articles about Python that I can reference"

  {
    "topic": "Why called Python",
    "question": [
      "Why is it called Python?"
    ],
    "answer": "When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python."

  {
    "topic": "How stable is Python",
    "question": [
      "How stable is Python"
    ],
    "answer": "Very stable. New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every 6 to 18 months since 1991, and this seems likely to continue. As of version 3.9, Python will have a new feature release every 12 months (PEP 602). \n\nThe developers issue bugfix releases of older versions, so the stability of existing releases gradually improves. Bugfix releases, indicated by a third component of the version number (e.g. 3.5.3, 3.6.2), are managed for stability; only fixes for known problems are included in a bugfix release, and it’s guaranteed that interfaces will remain the same throughout a series of bugfix releases."

  {
    "topic": "people using Python",
    "question": [
      "How many people are using Python"
    ],
    "answer": "There are probably millions of users, though it’s difficult to obtain an exact count. \n\n Python is available for free download, so there are no sales figures, and it’s available from many different sites and packaged with many Linux distributions, so download statistics don’t tell the whole story either.\n\nThe comp.lang.python newsgroup is very active, but not all Python users post to the group or even read it."

    "question": [
      "Have any significant projects been done in Pytho"
    ],
    "answer": "See https://www.python.org/about/success for a list of projects that use Python. Consulting the proceedings for past Python conferences will reveal contributions from many different companies and organizations. \n\nHigh-profile Python projects include the Mailman mailing list manager and the Zope application server. Several Linux distributions, most notably Red Hat, have written part or all of their installer and system administration software in Pytho"

      "What new developments are expected for Python in the futur"
    ],
    "answer": "See https://peps.python.org/ for the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). PEPs are design documents describing a suggested new feature for Python, providing a concise technical specification and a rationale. Look for a PEP titled “Python X.Y Release Schedule”, where X.Y is a version that hasn’t been publicly released yet. \n\n New development is discussed on the python-dev mailing list."

  {
    "topic": "incompatible changes to Python",
    "question": [
      "Is it reasonable to propose incompatible changes to Python"
    ],
    "answer": "In general, no. There are already millions of lines of Python code around the world, so any change in the language that invalidates more than a very small fraction of existing programs has to be frowned upon. Even if you can provide a conversion program, there’s still the problem of updating all documentation; many books have been written about Python, and we don’t want to invalidate them all at a single stroke."

  },

  {
    "topic": "Python good for beginning programmers?",
    "question": [
      "Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?"
    ],
    "answer": "Yes.\n\n It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students may be better served by learning Python as their first language. Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in their very first course."
